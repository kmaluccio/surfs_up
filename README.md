# Surfs_up
This project involves a weather analysis to see how successful a surf shop would be during different months of the year. We look at the reported temperatures in June and December. Then, based on the summary statistics from these months we make a recommendation about opening a surf shop in this area.

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this weather data analysis is to determine whether or not investing in a surf shop would be a smart decision. Based on the weather data for the months of June and December, we use the statistics to determine whether or not a surf shop could be successful in the area.

## Results
- June temperatures range from 64 degrees to 85 degrees with an average temperature of about 75 degrees; therefore: 
	- This is a good temperature range for surfers (as long as there are not thunderstorms every day), so most days people at the beach may be interested in surfing or surfers may be attracted to the area
	- A surf shop would do well during the month of June based on the weather data in this location
See the summary statistics for the month of June below:

See the summary statistics for the month of December below:
![December Stats](https://github.com/kmaluccio/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec-weather-stats.png)

- December temperatures range from 56 degrees to 83 degrees with an average of 71 degrees, therefore:
	- the temperatures are a good range for surfing as long as there are not severe storms for long amounts of time
	- When the temperature is below 60 degrees, this may seem on the colder side; however, this is still a temperature warm enough for local surfers or more experienced surfers although the people new to surfing may be more interested on warmer days. Based on the range of temperatures, there are warmer days when more people will want to try surfing, so the shop should still do well in December at this location
- Note the standard deviation for June and December is between 3 and 4 degrees which means the temperatures tend to be close to the average since this number is small which is good for the shop (because the temperature is less likely to be too low for people to surf)
- Overall, the surf shop would be a good investment based on the weather and location

## Summary
Based on the results analyzing the data for June and December, we can conclude that the weather should have a positive affect on the surf shop and it would be a good investment. Additional queries to consider would be precipitation, wind, and tides. Understanding the temperature is important, but if we can also analyze the rainfall and wind then this will tell us when the surf shop may or may not do well. If there is a lot of rain or wind regularly, this will make it more difficult for people to surf and the shop may not be as successful as it would be if there were less rain and less wind. Keeping in mind that some rain or wind is okay for surfing as long as the temperatures are not too cold. Lastly, if data about the tides is available, this will be useful to determine what times the surf will be more popular. Note that higher tides cause the waves to break more onto themselves which makes surfing more difficult, so the shop wants to be aware of when tides are too high and when they are lower so they know when the conditions are better for surfers.
